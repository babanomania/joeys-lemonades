# Project Requirements Document: Joey's Lemonade Stand App

## Project Overview

Joey's Lemonade Stand App is a fun, interactive platform designed for kids and families to enjoy ordering delicious lemonades while earning rewards. The app makes it easy for users to choose between three delicious options—Classic Lemon, Strawberry Twist, and Minty Fresh—and customize their order with little extras like extra sweetness or ice. In addition, a built-in rewards system motivates customers by automatically minting NFTs on the Solana devnet when they reach a defined purchasing threshold—enabling them to claim free lemonade rewards later.

The purpose behind the app is to bring a digital twist to the traditional lemonade stand, merging playful design with modern technology. Key objectives include ensuring a smooth user experience for all age groups, integrating a secure payment process using Solana devnet, and maintaining precise tracking of transaction histories and reward statuses with Supabase. Success is measured by a seamless ordering process, efficient NFT minting as customer rewards, and an engaging, professional look powered by Next.js and Chakra UI.

## In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A playful yet professional landing page with clear call-to-action to sign up or connect a Solana wallet.
*   User registration and wallet connection flows supporting popular Solana wallets.
*   An interactive menu with three lemonade options (Classic Lemon, Strawberry Twist, Minty Fresh) available in two sizes each, with customizable options such as extra sweetness and ice.
*   A secure payment system utilizing Solana devnet, complete with real-time transaction confirmations and error handling (e.g., insufficient funds, network delays).
*   Automatic minting of unique NFT rewards upon reaching a set threshold of purchases or expenditure.
*   A robust backend built on Supabase to store detailed transaction histories, customer profiles, and reward statuses.
*   An admin dashboard for managing orders, transactions, inventory, and NFT reward processes.
*   An integrated support system featuring ticket submission, an FAQ section, and a potential chatbot for immediate assistance.
*   A professional, consistent design implemented with Next.js for the frontend and styled using Chakra UI, leveraging a vibrant citrus color palette and clean modern fonts like Open Sans or Lato.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Support for payment methods beyond the Solana devnet.
*   Extensive role separation beyond Customer, Admin, and a potential combined Staff role (if needed).
*   Any offline ordering or cash-based transactions.
*   Advanced functionalities such as multi-store management or complex inventory forecasting.
*   Pre-minted NFT distribution, as NFTs will be minted automatically at the moment of reward threshold achievement.
*   Integration with third-party tools for non-essential services beyond the primary support ticket and FAQ mechanism.

## User Flow

A new user lands on a vibrant and playful landing page that showcases Joey’s Lemonade Stand. The page welcomes visitors with colorful citrus-inspired graphics and clear options to either sign up, register an account, or connect their existing Solana wallet. The registration flow gathers only essential information, making it accessible and kid-friendly. Once registered, users are guided to link a Solana wallet with supportive hints and prompts to ensure the connection process is simple and error-free.

After the frontend registration and wallet integration, the user is directed to browse the interactive lemonade menu. Here, users can see detailed descriptions of each lemonade flavor along with available sizes and prices. With options to customize their order (for instance, extra sweetness or ice), customers then select what they'd like to purchase. The payment page provides a concise summary of their order, and upon confirming, the app processes their Solana devnet transaction. During this process, real-time feedback is provided with progress indicators and error messages if needed. When successful, the customer sees a confirmation screen and, if eligible, an NFT reward is automatically minted and added to their connected wallet, which is tracked via Supabase on the backend.

## Constraints & Assumptions

*   The NFT minting process depends on timely and consistent availability of the Solana devnet.
*   Supabase will be the single source for storing transaction data and might rely on network reliability for synchronization.
*   The app is primarily targeted at children and families; therefore, the design and interactions must be simple, intuitive, and engaging.
*   Payment functionality is solely based on Solana devnet transactions; no other payment integrations will be supported.
*   The success threshold for NFT reward issuance is predefined (e.g., 5 purchases/month or spending 10 Solana tokens) and cannot be dynamically adjusted without further development.
*   Integration with UX libraries (such as Chakra UI) and IDE tools (Windsurf) is assumed to be straightforward and compatible with the chosen tech stack.

## Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API and Blockchain Dependency:**

    *   Potential issues with Solana devnet’s transaction confirmation times or downtime could affect the payment process.
    *   Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and retry logic with clear user messaging.

*   **Wallet Connection Challenges:**

    *   Ensuring compatibility across various popular Solana wallets might lead to unforeseen integration issues.
    *   Mitigation: Thorough testing on multiple wallets and clear guides for users on the connection process.

*   **NFT Minting Delays:**

    *   Minting processes may experience lags that could lead to delayed reward notifications.
    *   Mitigation: Asynchronous processing with progress indicators and fallback mechanisms for manual intervention via the admin dashboard.

*   **Data Consistency in Supabase:**

    *   Synchronization of transaction histories, reward statuses, and user data might face consistency challenges during high loads.
    *   Mitigation: Optimize database queries and implement transaction logging to secure data integrity in real-time.

*   **User Experience Trade-offs:**

    *   Balancing a playful, kid-friendly design with a professional interface may lead to design conflicts.
    *   Mitigation: Iterative UI testing and feedback loops with target audience adjustments to maintain both fun and professional elements.
