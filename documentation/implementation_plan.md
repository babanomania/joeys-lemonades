# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Install Node.js v20.2.1 on your workstation. (**Project Requirements: Tech Stack Setup**)

2.  Install Next.js version 14 (exactly) in your project repository; this version is chosen for compatibility with modern AI coding tools and LLM models. (**Project Requirements: Tech Stack – Frontend**)

3.  Set up the Windsurf IDE environment by creating a new repository using the Windsurf starter kit. (**Project Requirements: IDE**)

4.  Create directories for frontend and backend code:

    *   `/frontend`
    *   `/backend` (**Project Requirements: Code Organization**)

5.  Create a root `.env` file to store environment variables for Supabase credentials and Solana devnet connection. (**Project Requirements: Data Protection & Blockchain Setup**)

6.  **Validation**: Run `node -v` and verify Next.js version by running `npx next --version` inside the project directory.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Create the landing page by adding a file at `/frontend/pages/index.js` using Next.js 14 and Chakra UI. Include a vibrant citrus color scheme (lemon yellow, lime green, orange) and modern fonts (Open Sans, Lato). (**Project Requirements: Landing/Onboarding, Professional Design**)
2.  Develop a wallet connection component at `/frontend/components/WalletConnect.js` to let users sign up or connect their Solana wallet. (**Project Requirements: Landing/Onboarding & Payment**)
3.  Create the interactive Menu page at `/frontend/pages/menu.js` showing three lemonade types (Classic, Strawberry, Minty) in two sizes (Small, Large) with customizable options (sweetness, ice) using Chakra UI components. (**Project Requirements: Menu, App Flow Summary**)
4.  Add pricing and order customization features on the Menu page with clear confirmation buttons (using Chakra UI form components). (**Project Requirements: App Flow Summary – Menu/Ordering**)
5.  Build the Payment page at `/frontend/pages/payment.js` that interfaces with Solana devnet; include real-time confirmation messages and proper error handling. (**Project Requirements: Payment**)
6.  Develop the Rewards page at `/frontend/pages/rewards.js` to display automatically minted NFTs when customer thresholds are reached. (**Project Requirements: Rewards**)
7.  Create the Admin Dashboard page at `/frontend/pages/admin.js` for monitoring orders, transactions, inventory, and NFT reward status; design UI components in line with a playful yet professional design. (**Project Requirements: Admin Dashboard**)
8.  Add a Customer Support page at `/frontend/pages/support.js` that features a support ticket form and FAQ section, leaving hooks for future chatbot integration. (**Project Requirements: Customer Support**)
9.  **Validation**: Run the development server using `npm run dev` and verify that all frontend pages render correctly according to design specs.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Set up a Supabase project and create a database with tables for users, orders, transactions, and NFT reward statuses. (**Project Requirements: Data Storage**)
2.  In `/backend/config/supabase.js`, configure the connection to Supabase using environment variables from the `.env` file. (**Project Requirements: Data Protection**)
3.  Create an API endpoint for order processing by adding file `/backend/api/order.js` with a `POST /api/order` route to handle lemonade orders and custom options. (**Project Requirements: Menu/Ordering**)
4.  Develop an API endpoint for Solana payment integration in `/backend/api/solanaPayment.js` to securely process transactions on the Solana devnet. (**Project Requirements: Payment, Constraints & Assumptions**)
5.  Implement an API endpoint for NFT rewards in `/backend/api/nftReward.js` that triggers NFT minting when a customer reaches 5 purchases/month or 10 Solana tokens spent. (**Project Requirements: Rewards**)
6.  Create an API endpoint for support ticket submission at `/backend/api/supportTicket.js` to log and manage incoming support requests. (**Project Requirements: Customer Support**)
7.  Code necessary server-side business logic to validate transactions, manage ordering status, and ensure data consistency in Supabase. (**Project Requirements: Known Issues & Constraints**)
8.  **Validation**: Use a tool like Postman to send test requests to each endpoint (`/api/order`, `/api/solanaPayment`, `/api/nftReward`, `/api/supportTicket`) and check for expected responses.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  In `/frontend/services/orderService.js`, implement API calls using axios or fetch to connect the Menu page with the backend `/api/order` endpoint. (**Project Requirements: App Flow Summary – Menu/Ordering**)
2.  Integrate the wallet connection component on the frontend with blockchain libraries (e.g., @solana/web3.js) to interface with the Solana devnet for payments. (**Project Requirements: Payment, Constraints & Assumptions**)
3.  Connect the Payment page to the backend `/api/solanaPayment` endpoint to process transactions and implement error handling for transaction or wallet connection issues. (**Project Requirements: Payment, Known Issues**)
4.  Wire the NFT reward functionality in the frontend to invoke the `/api/nftReward` endpoint upon reaching defined thresholds, updating the rewards display accordingly. (**Project Requirements: Rewards**)
5.  Link the customer support form on the Support page to the `/api/supportTicket` endpoint to submit and track support tickets. (**Project Requirements: Customer Support**)
6.  **Validation**: Perform end-to-end testing by placing a sample order, processing payment, triggering NFT reward conditions, and submitting a support ticket; verify data consistency in Supabase.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Build the frontend for production using the Next.js build command (`npm run build`) ensuring production optimizations and fast load times (2–3 seconds). (**Project Requirements: Non-Functional Requirements**)
2.  Deploy the Next.js frontend to a cloud provider (such as Vercel) and configure environment variables (Supabase keys, Solana devnet URL) in the cloud settings. (**Project Requirements: Data Protection & Blockchain**)
3.  Deploy or connect the backend API endpoints to Supabase Functions (or a similar serverless backend) ensuring secure API calls and proper monitoring. (**Project Requirements: Data Storage & Security**)
4.  **Validation**: Run smoke tests on the deployed application by accessing the landing page, placing orders, processing a payment, minting an NFT, and submitting a support ticket; confirm that all functionalities work correctly in production.

# Notes

*   Next.js version 14 is used exactly as specified to ensure compatibility with modern AI coding tools and LLM-driven IDE features.
*   Regular testing during each phase will mitigate issues with Solana devnet transactions, wallet connections, NFT minting delays, and Supabase data consistency.

This plan addresses both technical details and user stories as outlined in the project summary, ensuring an effective implementation of Joey's Lemonade Stand app.
