# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user lands on Joey’s Lemonade Stand App, they are greeted by a vibrant and engaging landing page that reflects the playful yet professional style of the app. The first screen clearly introduces the experience and offers easy-to-understand options to sign up or connect a Solana wallet. New users can choose to register by providing minimal essential information, ensuring that even children and families can quickly begin their journey. In addition to a standard email sign-up option, the app also provides a streamlined wallet connection process for those who wish to use their Solana wallet directly. If a user forgets their password, a friendly and straightforward recovery process is available, guiding them step-by-step to reset their credentials and recover access. Once signed in, users have options to securely sign out when they are finished with their session.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, the user is directed to the main dashboard where they are presented with an interactive view built with a professional design powered by Chakra UI. The dashboard serves as the central hub and displays clear navigation options for exploring the menu, viewing orders, checking reward statuses, and accessing support. The interface is organized with an intuitive layout that features a top header with essential notifications and a sidebar that allows quick access to the menu, order history, rewards section, and support center. This design makes it very clear where to click next, whether the user wants to make a new purchase or check out their profile details.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

From the main dashboard, the customer’s journey continues as they explore the interactive menu. On the menu page, users can view the three different lemonade options: Classic Lemon, Strawberry Twist, and Minty Fresh. Each lemonade option is displayed with details about available sizes and clear pricing. Users are able to customize their lemonade order by selecting options like extra sweetness or ice, and then proceed to a confirmation page where the full details and cost of their order are clearly presented. Once the order is confirmed, the customer is guided to a secure payment page that prompts them to connect their Solana wallet if it is not already linked. Payment processing on this page is handled through the Solana devnet and includes real-time transaction confirmations. A progress indicator shows the status of the blockchain transaction and, upon successful payment, the user is taken to an order confirmation screen that displays the receipt and details of their purchase. If the customer qualifies as a regular by crossing the defined threshold, an NFT is automatically minted and added to their wallet, which they can view later in the rewards section. For those managing the app, an admin section is also integrated into the flow, allowing Joey or a guardian to oversee orders, track transaction histories stored in Supabase, manage inventory, and even manually intervene in the NFT reward process when needed. Additionally, a support or feedback page is easily reachable from the main dashboard for any customer who wants to report issues related to order payments, NFT minting, or general app usage.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the app, users have a dedicated area where they can update their personal information and adjust their account settings. This page provides options to modify profile details, update linked wallet information, and configure notification preferences so that users can stay informed about their order status and reward updates. If a customer wishes to change their account settings, the process is straightforward and guided by easy-to-follow prompts. In cases where changes have been made, users can simply return to the main dashboard to continue their activity, enjoying a seamless return to browsing the menu or accessing the rewards section. The settings area also includes links to manage support tickets and review past inquiries, ensuring that users have full control over their experience in the app.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the user journey, the app is designed to handle errors and alternate paths gracefully. If a user enters incorrect information during sign-up or any step of the order process, clear error messages appear on the screen with instructions on how to correct the mistake. During payment, if there are issues such as insufficient funds or network problems on the Solana devnet, the user is promptly informed with an easy-to-understand message and suggestions to retry or verify wallet information. When transaction errors occur, the app provides a fallback page that outlines the issue and offers choices to either reinitiate the payment process or navigate back to the main dashboard. Similarly, if there are connectivity issues that disrupt normal operations, the app displays an informative error page that communicates the problem and guides the user on how to get back on track, either by attempting to refresh or by reaching out to the support team through the integrated ticket system.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

Joey’s Lemonade Stand App offers a complete journey that starts with a welcoming and playful onboarding experience where users can easily register and connect their wallets. After signing in, the main dashboard provides clear navigation through an interactive menu, secure payment processing, and a unique rewards system that mints NFTs to reward loyal customers. The app smoothly guides users through each step—from selecting and customizing their lemonade, confirming orders through a blockchain-integrated payment system, to receiving clear confirmation and digital receipts. It also includes a supportive area for account management and error handling that ensures users are not left stranded if issues arise. Internal administrative tools further help Joey or his guardian manage operations, ensuring that the entire experience is both fun and secure. With detailed transaction logging in Supabase and clearly designed support options, the app not only provides a delightful ordering experience for children and families but also maintains high standards of reliability and professionalism.
